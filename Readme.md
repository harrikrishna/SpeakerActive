# SpeakerActive

Do you have external speakers which regularly shut down when in use at low volume? I do and it's incredibly irritating, so I made this app out of frustration. It lives in your macOS menu bar and prevents power-saving switch-offs by playing an inaudible, low-frequency tone at regular intervals for as long as you like (well, up to four hours - power-saving actually seems fairly reasonable by that point).

## Installation

I haven’t got a paid Apple developer account so haven’t been able to sign/notarise the app - you may have to click through warning messages on both the download and installation. If you haven’t installed an app from an unauthorised developer before please see the accompanying Installation doc (it’s really easy).

## About

The reason this is version 2.0 is because I made the original version around 3 years ago and it’s lived in my menu bar ever since. It was just a basic on/off loop button but I’ve used it pretty much every day ever since, so I figured someone else out there might be looking for something similar.

As a bit of a portfolio project I’ve given it a proper interface/array of options etc (I’m not much of a coder but have managed to figure out SwiftUI through endless googling). It'll only work on macOS Ventura I'm afraid (it uses MenuBarExtra, a fairly new SwiftUI addition) so if you’re on an older version and want something like this let me know and I can send the original basic toggle.

## Contact

There’s some troubleshooting notes in the app itself and it all works fine for my own speakers (KRK Rokits), but if it doesn’t fix your annoying speaker problems then apologies for giving you false hope. If you notice any small bugs or anything that needs fixing, feel free to get in touch at: <harrilyons@gmail.com> and I’ll see if I can sort it out.
