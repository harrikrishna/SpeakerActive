# Installation:

If you’re running the default macOS security settings, this app won’t launch as I’m an unidentified developer (you may even have to click through a warning to download it I'm afraid, depending on your browser). To run it for the first time, you’ll have to either:

---

**Right-click** or **control-click** on the app > click **Open** > click **Open** again on the following warning.

or:

Once you receive the initial warning, go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > scroll down and click **‘Open Anyway’** near the message explaining the app was blocked from running.

---

It's all pretty easy and after that you can drag it into your Applications folder and it’ll run fine from then on.

I did plan to get the app notarised by Apple but I didn't realise you needed to pay for a proper developer account, so given that a) it’s free and won’t make me any money, b) I haven’t got much money right now anyway and c) I don't know if I'll ever code & publish another app, I decided against it. 

Apologies for any inconvenience, if you have any trouble installing drop me an email at: <harrilyons@gmail.com>
